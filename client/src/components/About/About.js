            <h1>About us</h1>
            <p>Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the wind be a happy little seascape.</p>

            <p>If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a fewows to your soul. We don't have anything but happy trees here. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. This is gonna. You'll see. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Let's have a happy little tree in here.</p>
            
            <p>All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. In this world, everything can be happy. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out.</p>
            
            <p>Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Maybe there's a little something happening right here. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet.</p>
            
            <p>I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. A beautiful little sunset. Let's have a little bit of fun today.</p>
            
            <p>Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything.</p>
            
            <p>Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves.
